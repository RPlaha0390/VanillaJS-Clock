# Vanilla JS Clock 

## About App

This is a very simple real time (UTC+00:00) vanilla JavaScript clock. The app uses CSS3 transitions for animations. 
The app was purely built to showcase some vanilla JavaScript code.

Enjoy 

## Build

There are no building tools for this app. The app consists of a ```index.html``` file, a ```script.js``` file, and a ```style.css``` file. Feel free to customise the files if you wish.

Enjoy!
